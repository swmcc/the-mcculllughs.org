        The McCulloughs is a personal project by <%= link_to "Stephen McCullough (swmcc)", "https://swm.cc", class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline", target: "_blank", rel: "noopener" %>.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-4 mt-8">Why Build This?</h2>

      <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Our family has photos spanning from the 1930s to present day. Rather than trust them to platforms like Flickr or Facebook that could change ownership, modify terms, or disappear entirely, we built our own space.
      </p>

      <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Remember <%= link_to "Twitpic", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitpic", class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline", target: "_blank", rel: "noopener" %>? It shut down in 2014 and took millions of photos with it. Photobucket started charging people to access their own images. When you upload to Flickr, you're trusting Yahoo (or SmugMug, or whoever owns it next) with your photos.
      </p>

      <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I'm tired of trusting other people's servers with our family history. Now our photos live on our own infrastructure. They're ours, they're private (unless we choose to share them), and they'll be here as long as we want them to be.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-800 mb-4 mt-8">Features</h2>

      <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Photos can be organised into galleries, tagged, and shared publicly via unique links — making it easy to share specific moments with friends and extended family without giving up control.
      </p>

      <p class="text-neutral-600 leading-relaxed">
        A simple, focused place for family photos without the noise, the ads, or the uncertainty.
